 ## 3. Trying out commands 
 
 * Practicing is a great way to memorize commands! 
 * Some commands I would reccommend starting to familiarize yourself with are : 
    * pwd - “Print working directory” Used to display the current working directory (according to Monday Lecture Professor Politz cse 15l handout)
    * ls - <path> - “List” Used to list the files and folders the given path (according to Monday Lecture Professor Politz cse 15l handout)
